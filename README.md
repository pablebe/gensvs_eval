# Towards Reliable Objective Evaluation Metrics for Generative Singing Voice Separation
This repository accompanies the submission titled "Towards Reliable Objective Evaluation Metrics for Generative Singing Voice Separation".

The repository is organized in four subfolders with the following contents:

## 00_training_and_inference
Contains all code required to train the HTDemucs, Mel-RoFo. (S) (train_baseline.py) and SGMSVS model (train_sgmsvs.py), as well as the used train script to finetune the vocoder-based BigVGAN.
The subfolder 00_training_and_inference/sgmsvs/sgmse is a third party folder taken from [1].


## 01_objective_evaluation
Contains all code required to carry out inference with the trained model as well as 

## 02_subjective_evaluation

## 03_correlation_analysis

## 04_audio_examples

## Licensing
All third-party code is contained in separate folders, each of which is specifically listed in this README.md file. The corresponding LICENSE files for each third-party folder are located within their respective directories.
