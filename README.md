# Towards Reliable Objective Evaluation Metrics for Generative Singing Voice Separation
This repository accompanies the submission titled "Towards Reliable Objective Evaluation Metrics for Generative Singing Voice Separation".

The repository is organized in four subfolders with the following contents:

## 00_training_and_inference
Contains all code required to train the HTDemucs, Mel-RoFo. (S) (train_baseline.py) and SGMSVS model (train_sgmsvs.py), as well as the used train script to finetune the vocoder-based BigVGAN. 
## 01_objective_evaluation
Contains all code required to carry out inference with the trained model as well as 

## 02_subjective_evaluation

## 03_correlation_analysis

## 04_audio_examples
