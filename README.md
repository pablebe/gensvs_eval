## üìà Benchmark you own metrics
A simple Python script to benchmark objective metrics on our DMOS data using the paper's correlation analysis is included in the Zenodo dataset available at [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.15911723.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15911723).<br>
Instructions for benchmarking your own audio quality metrics are provided in the dataset‚Äôs Readme.md file.

## üèÉüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è Model Inference and Embedding-based MSE Evaluation

If you want to use the proposed generative models (SGMSVS, MelRoFo (S) + BigVGAN) to separate singing voice from musical mixtures, or if you want to compute the embedding-based MSE of MERT or Music2Latent embeddings take a look at our [PyPi package](https://pypi.org/project/gensvs/).

## üöÄ Getting Started:
We have released a [PyPi package](https://pypi.org/project/gensvs/) that enables straightforward inference of the generative models (SGMSVS & MelRoFo (S)+BigVGAN) presented in the paper. It also facilitates the computation of the embedding-based mean squared error (MSE) for the MERT and Music2Latent embeddings, which exhibited the highest correlation with DMOS data in our study. Besides enabling easy model inference and embedding-based MSE computation (currently only for MERT and Music2Latent), this package can be used to run all the training code provided in this GitHub repository. Information on how to set up an environment to run the inference and training code can be found below (see I.). You will also find instructions on setting up conda environments to reproduce the computation of all the metrics included in our study and to carry out the correlation analysis outlined in the paper (see II., III.).
### I. ```gensvs_env```: Conda environment for easy model inference, computation of MSE on MERT/Music2Latent embeddings and model training 
1. Create conda environment: ```$ ./env_info/gensvs_env.yml```
2. Activate conda environment ```$ conda activate gensvs_env```
2. Install [gensvs](https://pypi.org/project/gensvs/) package: ```$ pip install gensvs```
3. [Alternative] Run Bash script that sets up conda environment and installs [gensvs](https://pypi.org/project/gensvs/) from root directory: [```$ ./env_info/setup_gensvs_env.sh```](https://github.com/pablebe/gensvs_eval/blob/main/env_info/setup_gensvs_env.sh)

### II. ```gensvs_eval_env```: Conda environment for computation of all non-embedding-based intrusive and non-intrusive metrics and for the correlation analysis
Set up the following environment for evaluating all non-intrusive metrics of the paper, as well as for plot and *.csv export.
1. Create conda environment: ```$ ./env_info/svs_eval_env.yml```
2. Activate conda environment: ```$ conda activate gensvs_eval_env```
2. Install additional python dependencies: ```$ pip install -r ./env_info/svs_eval_env.txt```
3. Build the [ViSQOL API](https://github.com/google/visqol) and place in folder within the root directory
   - >**Note:** URL and SHA256 of Armadillo headers in the file "WORKSPACE" need to be changed to a recent version (https://sourceforge.net/projects/arma/files/)
4. To compute metrics with the PEASS-toolkit in the folder [```./01_evaluation_and_correlation/peass_v2.0.1```](https://github.com/pablebe/gensvs_eval/tree/main/01_evaluation_and_correlation/peass_v2.0.1) Matlab (version<2025a) is required to execute Python's Matlab engine   

### III. ```gensvs_fad_mse_eval_env```: Conda environment for evaluation intrusive embedding-based metrics
For computation of FAD and MSE evaluation metrics in addition to MERT/Music2Latent MSEs you'll need an additional conda environment. Please follow the steps below to set the environment up:
1. Create the conda environment: ```$ conda env create -f ./env_info/svs_fad_mse_eval_env.yml``` 
2. Install additional python dependencies: ```$ pip install -r ./env_info/svs_fad_mse_eval_env.txt```  
3. Test fadtk installation with: ```$ python -m fadtk.test```

## üßÆ Evaluation and Correlation Analysis

Within the folder [```01_evaluation_and_correlation```](https://github.com/pablebe/gensvs_eval/tree/main/01_evaluation_and_correlation) all code to compute all objective evaluation metrics, the evaluation of the DCR test results and the correlation analysis of the paper are collected.

All metrics, listening test results, DMOS ratings, and the audio used for both metric computation and loudness-normalized listening tests are available on Zenodo: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.15911723.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15911723), where a single CSV file combines all computed metrics, DMOS ratings, and individual ratings for each audio sample. The dataset also includes instructions and an example Python script to help you benchmark your own audio quality metric by calculating correlation coefficients on our dataset. If you are only interested in the final data, you can ignore the individual CSV files located in the [```./04_evaluation_data```](https://github.com/pablebe/gensvs_eval/tree/main/03_evaluation_data) folder, as they reflect intermediate steps during the paper‚Äôs development.

### Reproduce the evaluation carried out in the paper 
If you want to reproduce how we calculated all metrics, please download the data from [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.15911723.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15911723) and copy the data into the root directory. Then follow the steps below: 

### Compute Objective Evaluation Metrics
To calculate all objective metrics mentioned in the paper three python scripts are necessary. The evaluation of PAM as well as the FAD & MSE metrics are carried out in separate scripts. For the computation of the FAD & MSE metrics the conda environment ```gensvs_fad_mse_eval_env``` is necessary. All other metrics can be computed with the ```gensvs_eval_env```.

#### Compute FAD & MSE metrics 
To compute the FAD and MSE metrics we modified the code of Microsoft's fadtk [5]. The modified code can be found in ```./01_evaluation_and_correlation/fadtk_mod```.
The metrics can be computed with a python script. To show how the evaluation script is called we have added a examplary bash scripts.
- Python: [```./01_evaluation_and_correlation/gensvs_eval_fad_mse.py```](https://github.com/pablebe/gensvs_eval/blob/main/01_evaluation_and_correlation/gensvs_eval_fad_mse.py)
- Bash: [```$ ./01_evaluation_and_correlation/gensvs_eval_fad_mse.sh```](https://github.com/pablebe/gensvs_eval/blob/main/01_evaluation_and_correlation/gensvs_eval_fad_mse.sh)
- Required Conda environments:
   - II. ```gensvs_fad_mse_eval_env```
#### Compute PAM scores
To compute the PAM scores of https://github.com/soham97/PAM please use the following scripts:
- Python: [```./01_evaluation_and_correlation/gensvs_eval_pam.py```](https://github.com/pablebe/gensvs_eval/blob/main/01_evaluation_and_correlation/gensvs_eval_pam.py)
- Bash: [```$ 01_evaluation_and_correlation/gensvs_eval_pam.sh```](https://github.com/pablebe/gensvs_eval/blob/main/01_evaluation_and_correlation/gensvs_eval_pam.sh)
- Required Conda environments:
   - I. ```gensvs_eval_env```
#### Compute all other non-intrusive and intrusive metrics (BSS-Eval, PEASS, SINGMOS, XLS-R-SQA, Audiobox-AES)
To compute all other metrics mentioned in the paper please use
- Python: [```./01_evaluation_and_correlation/gensvs_eval_metrics.py```](https://github.com/pablebe/gensvs_eval/blob/main/01_evaluation_and_correlation/gensvs_eval_metrics.py)
- Bash: [```$ ./01_evaluation_and_correlation/gensvs_eval_metrics.sh```](https://github.com/pablebe/gensvs_eval/blob/main/01_evaluation_and_correlation/gensvs_eval_metrics.py)
- Required Conda environments:
   - I. ```gensvs_eval_env```
### Subjective Evaluation and correlation analysis
In order to evaluate the DMOS data, reproduce the correlation analysis results and export all the plots and *.csv files, the Python script can be executed under:
- Python: [```./01_evaluation_and_correlation/gensvs_eval_plots_and_csv_export.py```](https://github.com/pablebe/gensvs_eval/blob/main/01_evaluation_and_correlation/gensvs_eval_plots_and_csv_export.py)
- Required Conda environments:
   - I. ```gensvs_eval_env```
